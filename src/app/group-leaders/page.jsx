          <h1>Group Leader Guide for Using Real Talk AI with Young People</h1>
          <p>This guide will help you lead young people through the process of using this tool to generate either text or images. As you go through the tool, you’ll support the group in thinking critically about generative AI. There are four key pages in the tool, each with different activities and discussion points. Let&#39;s break it down to help you guide the group effectively.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Page 1: Choosing Whether to Generate Text or Image</p>
          <p>Objective: Help young people decide whether to generate text or an image.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Explain that they will have the choice to either generate text (this might be summarising an article, writing a poem, or asking ai a question) or an image (like artwork or a visual scene).
            </li>
            <li>Encourage them to think about what they would like to explore or create. Remind them that the goal is to think critically about AI while they use it.
            </li>
            <li>Ask open-ended questions to help them reflect on their choice:
              <ul>
                <li>Why do you want to create this?</li>
                <li>What would you like to learn from it?</li>
                <li>How do you think AI can help you create something new?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Page 2: Writing the Prompt and Thinking Critically</p>
          <p>Objective: Guide young people in crafting a good prompt and thinking critically about the issues they should consider.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Once they’ve chosen whether they want to generate text or an image, they will need to write a prompt (the idea or request that tells the AI what to create).
            </li>
            <li>Support them in coming up with ideas for their prompt using the &#34;expanders&#34; to help them consider why taking care over how their prompt is written is important.
            </li>
            <li>Encourage group discussion:
              <ul>
                <li>Ask participants to share their thoughts on whether the prompt could unintentionally reinforce harmful ideas or exclude certain groups.
                </li>
                <li>Use these questions to guide conversation:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Is there a way to change this prompt to make it more inclusive?</li>
                  <li>What does this prompt say about the world we live in?</li>
                  <li>How might AI misinterpret the prompt based on stereotypes or bias?</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Page 3: Viewing the AI Results and Reflecting Critically</p>
          <p>Objective: Help the group reflect on the AI’s output, focusing on critical thinking, bias, and stereotypes.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Once the young people have submitted their prompt, the AI will generate the result, either text or an image.
            </li>
            <li>Encourage Group Discussion:
              <ul>
                <li>Ask young people to share their thoughts on how the AI result might be influenced by bias or stereotypes. Explain these terms if unfamiliar with things like ‘bias, representation’.
                </li>
                <li>Key Questions to Discuss:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Do you think the result reflects what you expected? Why or why not?</li>
                    <li>Could this result have been different if we had used a different prompt?</li>
                    <li>What changes could we make to the prompt to avoid these issues?</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Page 4: Understanding AI’s Impact and Reflection</p>
          <p>Objective: Help young people understand the issues behind AI and reflect on what they’ve learned.<br/>
            Instructions for the Facilitator:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Review the AI result and its implications: The tool will highlight potential issues specific to the AI-generated content, such as bias or stereotypes in the slides.
            </li>
            <li>Encourage reflection on what they’ve learned about AI using this tool, with help from the expanders:
            </li>
            <li>Explore the articles and videos to learn more, or send them on after the session to young people who want to learn more.
            </li>
            <li>Final Thoughts: End with an open conversation, encouraging the young people to share their thoughts on the power of technology and their role in shaping it. Remind them that they are not just the consumers of technology but also its creators and critics.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Facilitator Tip: As you guide the group, always encourage open discussion. Let everyone share their opinions and ideas, and make sure the conversation stays respectful and inclusive. The goal is to empower young people to think critically about AI and its impact on the world around them.</p>

          <p>Thank you for leading this important discussion, and we hope this guide helps create an engaging, thoughtful, and reflective experience for everyone involved!</p>
